# Client Support Grid

This grid tries to gather Evennia-specific knowledge about the various clients and protocols used. Everyone's welcome to report their findings.

##### Legend: 

 - **Name**: The name of the client. If it's only available for a specific OS, it should be noted here too.
 - **Version**: Which version or range of client versions were tested.
 - **Comments**: Any comments or quirks on using this client with Evennia should be added here. Also note if some other protocol than Telnet is used (like Websockets, SSH etc).

## Workarounds for client issues:

### Issue: Telnet NOP displays as spurious character.

Known clients:

* [BlowTorch][16](Andr)
* [Mukluk][17](Andr)

Workaround:

* Set the command in game to `@option NOPKEEPALIVE=off` for the session, or use the `/save` parameter to disable it for that Evennian account permanently.
* Client-side: Set a gag-type trigger on the NOP character to make it invisible to the client.


### Issue: Won't send blank line on Enter key press.

Known clients: 

* [Potato][8]

Workaround: 

* Press Control Enter, then Enter key again to send blank line.
